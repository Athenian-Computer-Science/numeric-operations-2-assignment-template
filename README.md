# Numeric Operations 2 PCA: Time conversion

## Problem Description
For this assignment, [write a program](src/my_code.py) that asks the user for a time in seconds. Use floor division and modulo operators to convert seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. Print a response to the user with the converted time.


### Example
* with sample user responses in ():
```
Enter a number of seconds: (11730)
That is 3 hours, 15 minutes and 30 seconds.
```
Be sure to follow the format of the output. Your program will not pass the tests if you use a different format.
Don't worry about the grammar for now - it's fine if you see `1.0 seconds` or other similar issues with singulars and plurals.


### Submitting your assignment
* First, test your program by running it a few times. Does it work correctly? Check the formatting - is everything formatted nicely?
* When you are ready, commit and push to GitHub.
* Check the Pull Requests for feedback on code function and style. Fix any issues, then commit and push again. Repeat until no issues are found.
* When done, submit "done" on Canvas.
